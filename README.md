# SecretSanta
Python code for the popular game "Secret Santa" with email sending capabilities and hidden drawn names (it's truly secret for everyone including the programmer:)

## Features:
  1. Random name drawing
  2. Hidden results
  3. Automated email sending 
  
### About:
This code allows users with no programming knowledge (or with) to put their friends names and email iD's and let the code randomly allot the names and send out automated, formatted emails to everyone. Rather than having the programmer know the names of who's drawn whom, the code also stores the names in a variable which is not seen by the programmer allowing him to play the game himself.

The idea of the project came up when a few friends and I wanted to do something new compared to the traditional 'under the tree' christmas gifting. This project is useful especially in a post Covid world where meeting in person as a group is harder than ever before.
